**Steps**
1) In p5, create a demo scene with a cube and a directional light
2) Implement orbit controls, storing their logic in a different script
3) Create multiple 3D objects and store them in an array. Implement rendering logic
4) Implement export as .stl
5) Write the sculpture generation logic
6) Export and test in https://grid.space/kiri/
7) If necessary, add and refine JSCAD boolean union as an intermediate step, betweens sculpture generation and export
